# fIMR-based-Stability-Analysis
Here are models and codes used in our paper "Frequency-spectra Impedance Margin Ratio based Stability Analysis of IBR-Penetrated Systems" for future publication.
The codes are revised from Simplus Grid Tool: [Simplus Grid Tool](https://github.com/Future-Power-Networks/Simplus-Grid-Tool).

## Installation
Run InstallSimplusGT.m to install Simplus Grid Tool.

## Models
Data and Simulink models in our paper can be found in 'Simplus-Grid-Tool\IMRF_case'.
1) IEEE68_bad: the original case.
2) IEEE68_bad_revised_para: the case after revising parameters.

## Quick Start
1) Open Matlab, and include all folders and subfolders of this repo in Matlab's path.
2) Open UserMain.m in the root path of the repo, select the case, and click run.
3) Results can be viewed from workspace, or more conviently, from the newly designed Modal Analysis APP.
